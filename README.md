#Off canvas only navigation template

###Description

This is a movil first web page template that I made for an upcoming project but thought I would share it if someone found it useful. It's just a simple template or boilerplate that you can use to drop in content and make a webpage. The navigation is only accessible in the off canvas menu. The idea is that this would be for a webpage that has a long list of links that would not fit in a standard navigation bar at the top of a web page. 

###Technologies used

I've included the HTML file, CSS, and LESS. I used vanilla Javascript to access the off canvas menu. W3Schools off canvas tutorial provided the jumping off point for this.
